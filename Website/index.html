             <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.

                Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be weaponized. Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots should be treated with the same rights as humans.
                
                Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damage. </p>

             <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> 
                When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.
                
                Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.
                
                As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function. </p>

            The Commissioner of the United States Office of Patents, 1899, recommending that his office be abolished,
             quoted in The Economist, 2000, p. 5 There is nothing now to be foreseen which can prevent the United States
              from enjoying an era of business prosperity which is entirely without equal in the pages of trade history.
            (Sutliff, 1901) The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) – that is, computers, software, 
            telecommunications and the internet – and the large impact that these new technologies are having on the way 
            that society functions, have prompted many to claim that we have entered a new era, often referred to as the 
            ‘Third Industrial Revolution’, the ‘information age’ or the ‘new economy’. Previous industrial revolutions
             were also linked to the rise of new technologies: the First Industrial Revolution, concentrated in Britain
              from around 1760 to 1850, introduced Cort's puddling and rolling process for making iron, Crompton's mule 
              for spinning cotton and the Watt steam engine; </p>
